     <div><p>Many different factors affect how well we learn. While we can’t control all of these factors, there are many that we can.</p>
     <p>For example, fuel for our brain comes from calories in the food we eat. In fact, 20% of the calories we eat are used by our brain.</p>
     <p>Although not all calories help the brain, research suggests that some foods, such as egg yolk, whole grains, nuts, fish, dark leafy green vegetables, beans, strawberries and blueberries might be especially good for concentration and memory.</p>
     <p>Drinking enough water is also important. The brain is more than 70% water. If we don’t drink enough water, it affects our concentration. We need around six to eight glasses of non-sugary, non-alcoholic fluid each day. Moreover, studies suggest that the brain does not do well with sudden rushes of sugar, so sweet, fizzy drinks do not help the brain either.</p>
     <p>Remember also the importance of oxygen, which is carried to the brain by your blood. When you move your body, your blood flow increases and your brain gets more oxygen. Going for a walk, running, or riding a bike really help get oxygen to the brain, as do stretching and breathing deeply.</p>
